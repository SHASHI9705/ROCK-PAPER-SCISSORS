Currently i just learned about javascript so i thought to make a simple game.
This is a project of a game you might know "ROCK PAPER SCISSORS"
In this game you can click any of the option you want to play and the result will be shown on screen and you are playing this game with computer.
you can also reset the scores and play it again.
Enjoy!!
